  </h2>

Your use of the Site is subject to all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="text parbase section"><p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH ANIXTER AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ANIXTER.</p>
</div>
<div class="text parbase section"><p>In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms, you and Anixter agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of sixty (60) days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Chicago, Illinois. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Anixter are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Except as otherwise required under applicable law, you and Anixter intend and agree: (1) not to assert class action or representative action procedures and agree that they will not apply in any arbitration involving the other; (2) not to assert class action or representative action claims against the other in arbitration or otherwise; and (3) only to submit individual claims in arbitration and not seek to represent the interests of any other person or entity.</p>
</div>
<div class="text parbase section">
  <p>If settlement is not reached within sixty (60) days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Chicago, Illinois. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within ninety (90) days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.<br />
